# Level-4-Task-21--Capstone-Project-III-Create-a-React-app

## THE TASK AT HAND

For this Capstone Project, you will be tasked to create a simple game using React.

To be able to successfully do this, you will need to consolidate all the concepts you have learned about React, JSX and JavaScript so far.

Create a React app that allows users to play Hangman. The game picks a random word, which the user must then attempt to guess letter-by-letter. Too many incorrect guesses result in loss of the game. Iconically the process of losing is depicted by your character being hanged.

Assets for the game (random words) can be found in the task Dropbox. You need not make use of them if you don’t want to.

The game you create should meet the following criteria:

1. It should be created using Create React App.

2. It should include attractively styled components (at least 4 different types of components) that respond to user interaction. Feel free to use React-Bootstrap or another library and/or your own custom stylesheets.

3. A number of components should be rendered using the array.Map() method.

4. User interaction should modify the state of some components.

5. The state of two or more components should be synced.

6. The user should be able to restart the game.

7. The user should be clearly informed if they have “won” or “lost” the game.

8. The user should easily be able to request “help” that will inform the user about the rules of the game from the UI.

9. The UI should be attractive, easy to use and intuitive.

10. It should include a file called “readme.md” which explains the rules of the game. This file should also provide clear instructions that an end user will be able to follow to be able to install and run your app on their local machine.

11. The expert code reviewer should be able to launch your app by typing ‘npm start’ from the command line interface.

12. The file structure of the project should be well organized in line with guidelines here. The code should also be easy to read adhering to Google’s style guide about indentation, meaningful variable and component names etc.

13. Your code should be well documented with appropriate comments.

## Task

Follow these steps:

● Create a Hangman game using the Create React App Starter Kit.

● Ensure that the game adheres to ALL the criteria listed previously for this Capstone Project.

● Once this project is complete, push it to GitHub.

● Submit a link to your GitHub repo in a file called repo.txt.
